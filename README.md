# WEBSITE-TRAFFIC-DATA
Code Description
The provided Python code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a website traffic dataset. Here's what it does:

Libraries: It imports libraries like:

pandas for data manipulation.

matplotlib and seaborn for creating visualizations.

Data Upload: Allows the user to upload a CSV file containing website traffic data.

Data Cleaning:

Converts the Date column to datetime format for time-series analysis.

Cleans numerical columns (e.g., Page Views, Unique Visitors, Bounce Rate) by ensuring they contain valid data and removing invalid rows.

Visualization:

A line plot is created to visualize the trend of Page Views over time.

A heatmap is generated to show correlations between different metrics (e.g., how Bounce Rate relates to Unique Visitors).

Analysis:

Prints a correlation matrix to explore relationships between variables.

Outputs descriptive statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for insights into each metric.

This code is useful for identifying trends, relationships, and potential anomalies in website traffic data.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of simulated website traffic data. It contains the following columns:

Date: Represents the timeline for the data, recorded in a standard format.

Page Views: The total number of pages viewed on the website each day.

Unique Visitors: The number of distinct users visiting the site daily.

Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who leave the site after viewing only one page.

Average Time Spent (minutes): The average time a user spends on the website during a visit.

Exit Rate: The percentage of users leaving the site from a specific page
